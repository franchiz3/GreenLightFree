Only A Shot In The Perfect Green Window is Gurantted To Go In

Any Shot In the Green Window That Isn't In The Perfect Green Window Can Go Full White

Full White Releases Tend To Go In Even Less Often Than Late or Early

The Idea Is To Get Either As Close To OR Inside The Green Window

The Further From The Green Window Your Release Is, The Less Likely The Shot Will Go In
